### INSPIRATION


My main source of inspiration stems from the belief that in order to successfully engage with potential clients, sales executives, marketing executives, research teams, and customer service teams must remain up-to-date with the latest developments in their respective industries. Whether it's a new investment or a technological breakthrough, it's essential that they have a comprehensive understanding of the client's business moves.

To facilitate this process, I envision an extension that enables executives to easily access news topics related to the company or trend they are currently researching. By allowing them to quickly and conveniently look up news from any page, they can gain valuable insights into their client's business operations and make more informed decisions.

Ultimately, this approach can help improve the effectiveness of outreach efforts, as executives will be better equipped to engage with potential clients on a more informed and meaningful level. This, in turn, can lead to stronger client relationships, increased sales, and overall business success.

Moreover, The extension can save valuable time and effort by allowing executives to research news articles related to the company or trend they are interested in without having to open a new tab or switch to a separate search engine. With this streamlined approach, they can stay focused on their work while quickly accessing the information they need to engage with potential clients effectively. This convenience factor can help improve productivity and ultimately contribute to the overall success of the organization.
